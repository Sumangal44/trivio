; Removed invalid/unknown npm project config keys.
; These entries caused "Unknown project config" warnings during `npm install`.
; If you intended to disable a package manager's lockfile, remove the file instead
; or configure that package manager directly (pnpm/yarn). npm does not recognize
; these keys and will warn in future versions.
